Java's speciality: 


Java is Simple and Portable 

It is safe because pointers are not used.  

It is platform independent. 

It also achieves high performance by the Byte code, which will be portable and that will be converted to the native machine language 


**Example code:**


class HelloWorld  

{ 

public static void main(String args[])  

{  

System.out.println("Hello World!");  

}  

}

Class is the keyword for creating a class.. 

HelloWorld is the identifier/name of the class. 

 

main is the starting point of the program. 

void returns and gets nothing. 
public is the visibility/accessibility of the class. 

Statements are terminated using Semicolon ( ; ) 

 

When the programmer save the code, it is saved as a byte code with the extension ".class". 

Then the byte code is converted to the native code and the code gets executed.

**Variables**: 


It is name/identifier which holds up the value.  

 
Rules for naming a variable: 

1) A-Z letters and numericals can be used. 

2) $ and _ can be used. 

 

Note: 

Variable should never start with numericals and it should not have space in it. 

 

Example: 
 

Char Gender 

int a1 

float _blood 


**Data Types**: 


Int – It is a whole numberical value. 

float – It has a decimal value with two decimal points. 

char – It has single character. 

boolean – It has only TRUE and FALSE value. 

Null – It does not have value. 

 

Syntax of variable: 

<Variable type> <Variable name> 


Eg: int a; 


Initializing variable: 

<Variable type> <Variable name> = Value 


Eg: int a = 10; 
 

Getting a value from user: 

Scanner.nextLine()
