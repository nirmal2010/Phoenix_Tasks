Java's speciality: 

 

Java is Simple and Portable 

It is safe because pointers are not used.  

It is platform independent. 

It also achieves high performance by the Byte code, which will be portable and that will be converted to the native machine language 

 

Example code: 


class HelloWorld  

{ 

public static void main(String args[])  

{  

System.out.println("Hello World!");  

}  

}

Class is the keyword for creating a class.. 

HelloWorld is the identifier/name of the class. 

 

main is the starting point of the program. 

void returns and gets nothing. 
public is the visibility/accessibility of the class. 

Statements are terminated using Semicolon ( ; ) 

 

When the programmer save the code, it is saved as a byte code with the extension ".class". 

Then the byte code is converted to the native code and the code gets executed.
